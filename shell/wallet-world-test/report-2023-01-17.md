# Summary

- We have made the random wallet test
  - It creates multiple wallets and a new chain
  - From the world of wallets we do
    - Mine a random wallets
    - Make random transactions between the wallets
  - Then we search for inconsistencies
    - If the wallet panics due to some transactions
    - If results differ between execution
- During the development and the final execution of the experiment we found:
  - A bug was found during our first execution
    - It was related to error handling
    - It was quickly addressed
  - After the bug was addressed we continued development and testing
    - No more execution errors were found
- Using the output from the Wallets we got the opportunity to compare the results between execution and with different binaries
  - Although we are randomly mining and doing transactions, the number of mined blocks and number of transactions were the same
  - The diff between the results from LMDB and SQLite returned nothing, meaning the same outputs for LMDB and SQLite;

# Details of the experiment

The experiment consisted in building a closed environment with randomized operations on the wallets.
This forced the wallet to pass through several operations and tested its different dimensionalities.

## Dimentionalities tested

- Path of the wallet
- Number of coinbase blocks
- Number of transactions sent
- Number of transactions received
- Number of coins per transaction
- Wallet password
- Number of coins
  - On each type of coin
    - Blocked, Immature, etc

## Methodology used

For the experiment we have used two types of wallets:

- A walled from a world of wallets
  - One randomly generated wallet
- Purge wallet
  - Wallet we mine to confirm blocks

All the process was done using the usernet, with a new environment generated from the ground up:

- We are creating a new chain between execution
- We are creating new wallets between execution

### Steps done by the code

The steps are done using SH files.
Every variable can be changed on the go.

- Create a new chain
- Create a new wallet world with 10 wallets
- Mine half of the wallet world randomly with 10 blocks each
- Mine with the purge wallet to confirm all coinbases
- Make 10 random transactions with 15 coins
- Mine with the purge wallet to confirm all transactions
- Make 20 random transactions with 5 coins
- Mine with the purge wallet to confirm all transactions
- Make 30 random transactions with 1 coins
- Mine with the purge wallet to confirm all transactions
- Make 50 random transactions with 0.001 coins
- Mine with the purge wallet to confirm all transactions
- Mine with the purge wallet to process all Awaiting Confirmation transactions
- Collect information from the wallet world and the purge wallet

All the above steps are done for SQLite and LMDB.

## Results

In the end, one bug was found. It was related to the error handling, differing from the original LMBD implementation. After fixing the bug, no other issues were found.

The wallets generated the same results for both SQLite and LMBD.
The exact same info was perceived in both binaries.

## Limitations

The mining speed is a heavy limitation that we have faced. We were only reaching the speed of 1 block every 3 seconds.
