# Context

This is the wallet world experiment
Can be used to test different dimensionalities of the wallets and compare the results between binaries

# How to run

First, configure the `./variables.sh` with the path of your binaries

After that you can run the following:

```
./do-all.sh
```

For an example of how this test needs to be structured. The ./report-2023-01-17.md is an example of how the final report may look like

Or you can follow the step-by-step on the files it self
