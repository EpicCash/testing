# Testing

This repository is for having the tests regarding the Epic Cash CLI systems concentrated in one place.

We are currently using Cucumber combined with Rust to run most test scenarios.

For the production or adjustment of tests, we will use the test coverage table and its descriptions in the [test_coverage.md](https://github.com/EpicCash/testing/blob/main/test_coverage.md) file.
